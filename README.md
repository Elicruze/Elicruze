- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elicruze
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, art, creation in general tbh, reading/writing, music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift coding, learning to utilize github and making mobile apps with Xcode. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on swift related stuff, if you are making a app or game and need basic stuff, I might be able to help... but alas I am but a fedgling myself right now. 
- 📫 You can email me at elicruze@icloud.com or just send me a message.
